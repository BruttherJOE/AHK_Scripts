# AHK_Scripts
A collection of scripts I have written to automate stuff and get better QOL while using computers. These scripts will tend to be portable, in a .exe file, and is intended mainly for me to use. However, feel free to remix it and / or use it to your heart's content but please make sure to credit me.
